Privacy Policy for TradeNet Portfolio
=====================================

At TradeNet Portfolio, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our users.

The only required information for the app to work is some tokens to authenticate to Binance APIs. That token is only stored locally on your devices and never sent to our servers.

Please read Binance privacy policy for information on how they treat your tokens when using their API here: [https://www.binance.com/en/privacy](https://www.binance.com/en/privacy).

If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.



Children's Information
----------------------

Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.

TradeNet Portfolio does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13 (or any age).

Consent

By using our app, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its Terms and Conditions.
